I was born in Miskolc and grew up there also. Currently I am living in Balatonföldvár which is a very nice and attractive place near the lake Balaton.

My personal interest in IT began when i was child. In the primary school we had only one PC which marked as "dont touch it". Of course that's really exciting for a kid isn't it? :)
I started to learn IT and finally took the state exam in 2011 and became software engineer.

Now I work as software architect, and try to give the best for the collegues not only from professional aspect but also human point of view.
The last few years I have worked as a tech leader and learned a lot how can i help the guys in order to build up their competences. It is very important to me to see that i am useful and able to help.

That is my long story in short, but if I have piqued your interest, do not hesitate to contact me.
